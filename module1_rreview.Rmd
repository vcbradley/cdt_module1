```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Vectors

a. Generate 100 standard normal random variables, and keep only the ones which are greater than 1. Donâ€™t use a loop!
```{r cars}
all_norm = rnorm(100)
hist(all_norm)
hist(all_norm[all_norm > 1])
```

b. Write a function which takes two arguments n and min, and returns n independent random variables from a standard normal distribution truncated below by min. Let min default to 0.
```{r 1b}
rnorm_0 = function(n, min = 0){
  X = rnorm(n)
  X = unlist(lapply(X, max, min))
  return(X)
}

hist(rnorm_0(2000, 1))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
